# Welcome :raising_hand_man:
It's possible to look at three things endlessly: how the fire burns, how the water flows and how your project compiles without any errors

Strengths: Python

Weak sides: C++ (can create a simple console application)

# About me  :upside_down_face:
My name is Mikhail, I'm 17 years old. I have been programming for about 3 years and trying myself in different technologies such as:
- Game development with Unity
- Computer vision with python OpenCv
- Blockchain technologies (made a simple MVP blockchain on python and tested id with postman)
- Working with API like TMDB, VTope or Telegram API
- Heroku (deployed Telegram bot)

I try to find my way in the industry, so I use very different libraries like PyQT5, OpenCV, Selenium, Kivy, Requests, framework like Flask. Of course, I understand, that I know and use a small part of that libraries, but I continuosly improve myself.

I really like to solve problems that appear during programming. That's really nice feelings when projects works without errors.
